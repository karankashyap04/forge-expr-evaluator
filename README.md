# forge-expr-evaluator

A TypeScript evaluator for Forge expressions.

_Note_: the evaluator makes use of a forge parser built using Antlr; this is largely taken from
the [parser developed by Siddhartha Prasad](https://github.com/sidprasad/forge-antlr/)
with some minor modifications to the grammar.
